## Abstract

Current high-throughput single-cell multi-omics methods cannot concurrently map changes in (phospho)protein levels and the associated gene expression profiles. We present QuRIE-seq (Quantification of RNA and Intracellular Epitopes by sequencing) and use multi-factor omics analysis (MOFA+) to map signal transduction over multiple timescales. We demonstrate that QuRIE-seq can trace the activation of the B-cell receptor pathway at the minute and hour time-scale and provide insight into the mechanism of action of an inhibitory drug Ibrutinib.

## In this repository

Three pages contain code to process, analyse and create figures from the QuRIE-seq manuscript:

* [QC](QC.html) processes count tables (available at [GSE162461](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE162461)): filter high quality cells; normalize and scale counts.   
* [MOFA aIg](MOFAaIg.html) computes a model of cells stimulates with aIg molecule.   
* [MOFA ibru](MOFAibru.html) computes a model of cells stimulates with aIg molecule with or without prescence of ibrutinib.  

## Attribution


We are very thankful for the effords made by developers of [MOFA+](https://biofam.github.io/MOFA2/) and  [workflowr](https://github.com/jdblischak/workflowr). These (well documented) R-packages enable respectively extensive multimodal data-analysis and reproducible code documentation.
